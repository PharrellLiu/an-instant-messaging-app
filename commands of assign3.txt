Now you have started your instance, use these commands to build your environment: 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx gunicorn supervisor
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install Flask
sudo pip install mysql-connector-python

Then build your own database & your python api, follow the instructions of assign3
Please do not use any python3's feature in your api since we would use python2 here

Now we start in 2.4.1

About the gunicorn please use this command
gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers=4 iems5722_a3:app

About the supervisor, please vim your conf in the same directory of your python code
Please remember to change the command, directory & stdout_logfile
Then just follow the instruction of supervisor, it should be all correct

About nignx
Vim your conf in the same directory of your python code
Change the proxy_pass to 0.0.0.0
Then the commands are:
sudo cp iems5722_web.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo service nginx restart

Everything is done!
