# an instant messaging app
 
Introduction

This is an instant messaging app. Actually, it is from the assignments and final project of one of my courses. I overwrite it and add more functions. 

The code may have some errors or defects (actually there are some weird problems that I cannot solve), if you wanna issue me something, please.

About It

There are 4 main functions, login/register, private chat, chatroom chat, moments like Wechat.

The project has a server and a client. 

To the server, I used Flask to develop it and deployed it with Gunicorn, Supervisor, and Nginx. I also provide a txt file to show how I deploy the database.

To the client, it is an android app, I write some notes in it, it won't be hard to browse the code.

In The End

It is hard to describe the project specifically, so I don't want to write a lot here.

And like I said, it is from the final project of my course, and this is a group project, so I want to thank the members in my group here, Miss. YANG and Mr. CHEN.

OK, that's all. (it is hard to write the readme!)
